Customers rate hotel services
=============================
Overall process
---------------
  * Users can rate hotel services on a fixed scale of 1 to 10
  * They will do this by:
  * Either scanning a QR Code using any QR Code reader generic app;
  * Or entering a 4-digit code manually on a webpage
  * The user will be redirected to a target URL with an HTML page for rating
  * Good reviews 8 to 10 generate a post on TOL respective newsfeed.
  * Bad reviews 1 to 3 are sent by email to the admin.
  * We want to collect information about the user, like phone IMEI, location, phone nr, email (see what is possible)
  * Restrictions to implement: restrict same user from rating twice the same QR Code in a day
